`yakovenko/laravel-lighthouse-graphql-multi-schema` is a Laravel package that provides multi-schema support for Lighthouse GraphQL. It allows you to manage multiple GraphQL schemas within a single Laravel application, streamlining development and extending functionality.

## Installation

### Requirements

- PHP               : ^8
- Laravel           : ^9.0 || ^10.0 || ^11.0 || ^12.0
- Nuwave Lighthouse : ^6.0

> **New in v2.0.0:** Full support for Laravel Octane and long-lived workers!

## 🚀 Octane & Worker Support

**Since v2.0.0, this package is fully compatible with [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/octane) and any long-lived worker environment (Swoole, RoadRunner, etc).**

- `ASTCache` and `SchemaSourceProvider` are now registered with `bind` instead of `singleton` to ensure a fresh context per request.
- This change is required for correct schema resolution and cache separation in Octane/Swoole/RoadRunner.

### ⚠️ Breaking Change

If you relied on `ASTCache` or `SchemaSourceProvider` being singletons, please update your code accordingly.  
**From v2.0.0, these services are no longer singletons!**

#### How to upgrade

- Clear all caches:  
  `php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan lighthouse:clear-cache`
- Make sure you do not store the request object in any singleton or static property.
- Always use the `request()` helper to access the current request in your code.

### Install the Package

You can install the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require yakovenko/laravel-lighthouse-graphql-multi-schema
```

**Publish Configuration**

After installing the package, you need to publish the configuration file by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan lighthouse-multi-schema:publish-config
```

This will create a configuration file named `lighthouse-multi-schema.php` in the config/ directory, where you can set up your GraphQL schemas.

**Configuration**

In the config/lighthouse-multi-schema.php file, you can define your schemas and their settings. Here's an example configuration:

```php
return [
    'multi_schemas' => [
        'schema1' => [
            'route_uri'           => '/schema1-graphql',
            'route_name'          => 'schema1-graphql',
            'schema_path'         => base_path("graphql/schema1.graphql"),
            'schema_cache_path'   => env('LIGHTHOUSE_SCHEMA1_CACHE_PATH', base_path("bootstrap/cache/schema1-schema.php")),
            'schema_cache_enable' => env('LIGHTHOUSE_SCHEMA1_CACHE_ENABLE', false),
            'middleware' => [
                // Always set the `Accept: application/json` header.
                Nuwave\Lighthouse\Http\Middleware\AcceptJson::class,

                // Logs in a user if they are authenticated. In contrast to Laravel's 'auth'
                // middleware, this delegates auth and permission checks to the field level.
                Nuwave\Lighthouse\Http\Middleware\AttemptAuthentication::class,

                // Apply your custom middleware here.
                // For example:
                // App\Http\Middleware\ExampleSchemaMiddleware::class,
            ]
        ],
        'schema2' => [
            'route_uri'           => '/schema2-graphql',
            'route_name'          => 'schema2-graphql',
            'schema_path'         => base_path("graphql/schema2.graphql"),
            'schema_cache_path'   => env('LIGHTHOUSE_SCHEMA2_CACHE_PATH', base_path("bootstrap/cache/schema2-schema.php")),
            'schema_cache_enable' => env('LIGHTHOUSE_SCHEMA2_CACHE_ENABLE', false),
            'middleware' => [ ... ]
        ],
        // Add additional schemas as needed
    ],
];
```

**Middleware Support**

You can now add middleware specific to each GraphQL schema, allowing you to apply different middleware configurations based on the schema being used. Specify the middleware classes in the middleware array for each schema, and they will be applied to the corresponding routes.

**CSRF exceptions Laravel ^11**

To disable CSRF verification for your GraphQL routes in Laravel 11, update `bootstrap/app.php` with the following configuration:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Foundation\Application;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Configuration\Middleware;

return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        $middleware->validateCsrfTokens(except: [
            'schema1-graphql',
            'schema2-graphql',
            // Add other routes as needed
        ]);
    })
    ->create();
```

In the code above, routes such as schema1-graphql and schema2-graphql are excluded from CSRF protection. For older Laravel versions, you can still add the routes in VerifyCsrfToken.php.

**CSRF exceptions Laravel  ^9.0 || ^10**

Add your GraphQL routes to the CSRF exceptions.

Open the `App/Http/Middleware/VerifyCsrfToken.php` file and add your routes to the $except array.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken as Middleware;

class VerifyCsrfToken extends Middleware
{
    /**
     * The URIs that should be excluded from CSRF verification.
     *
     * @var array<int, string>
     */
    protected $except = [
        'schema1-graphql',
        'schema2-graphql',
        // Add other routes as needed
    ];
}
```

**Create Directories for Each Schema**

Organize your schema files into separate directories for each schema. The structure of these directories and how you split the files is up to you. Here's an example of one way to organize them:

example:
```
/graphql
├── schema.graphql
├── schema1.graphql
├── schema2.graphql
└── schema3.graphql
```

example:
```
/graphql
├── web
│   └── web.graphql ( #import /models/*.graphql, #import /request/*.graphql, general scalar, query and mutation, login, registration )
│   └── models ( Type, Enum, Input )
│   │	└── User.graphql
│   │	└── Order.graphql
│   │	└── Product.graphql
│   └── request ( Query, Mutation )
│   	└── user_request.graphql ( meUpdate, me )
│   	└── order_request.graphql  ( meOrders )
│   	└── product_request.graphql ( products, product )
├── crm
│   └── crm.graphql ( #import /models/*.graphql, #import /request/*.graphql, general scalar, query and mutation )
│   └── request ( Query, Mutation )
│   │	└── order_request.graphql  ( orders, order )
│   └── models ( Type, Enum, Input )
├── adm
│   └── adm.graphql ( #import /models/*.graphql, #import /request/*.graphql, general scalar, query and mutation )
│   └── request ( Query, Mutation )
│   │	└── user_request.graphql ( userCreate, userUpdate, userDelete, user, me, users )
│   │	└── order_request.graphql  ( orders, orders, orderUpdate, orderDelete, orderCreate )
│   │	└── product_request.graphql ( products, product, productUpdate, productDelete, productCreate )
│   └── models ( Type, Enum, Input )
└── api
    └── api.graphql ( #import /models/*.graphql, #import /request/*.graphql, general scalar, query and mutation )
    └── request ( Query, Mutation )
    └── models ( Type, Enum, Input )
```

### Console Command Example

The lighthouse:clear-cache command is used to manage the cache for your GraphQL schemas. Below are the available usages:

**1 - Clear Default Schema Cache**

The following command removes the default schema cache:

```
php artisan lighthouse:clear-cache
```

**2 - Clear All Schema Caches**

To clear the cache for all GraphQL schemas, run:

```
php artisan lighthouse:clear-cache all
```

This deletes all cached schema files, ensuring any changes made to the schemas are reflected the next time they are accessed.

**3 - Clear Cache for a Specific Schema**

You can also clear the cache for any other schema by replacing `{keyYourSchema}` with the desired schema name:

```
php artisan lighthouse:clear-cache {keyYourSchema}
```

example:
```
php artisan lighthouse:clear-cache schema1
```

Replace `{keyYourSchema}` with the actual name of the schema you want to target. This will specifically remove the cache for that schema only.

### Endpoint Schemas

Schema 1: Access the GraphQL schema at:
```domain.local/schema1-graphql```

Schema 2: Access the GraphQL schema at:
```domain.local/schema2-graphql```

Schema 3: Access the GraphQL schema at:
```domain.local/schema3-graphql```

### Usage

Once configured, you can use the defined routes for each schema in your application. Each route will utilize its corresponding GraphQL schema. You have a multi-schema setup that allows for an unlimited number of access points, each supporting various mutations and queries tailored to your specific needs. You can define each schema according to your project requirements.
This flexibility allows you to create distinct schemas for different parts of your application, ensuring that each area can have customized queries and mutations as needed.
